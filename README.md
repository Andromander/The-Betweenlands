*The Betweenlands*
A large and expansive mod for Minecraft by Angry Pixel that adds a whole new dimension to the game, with new blocks, items, mobs, strucutres, biomes, sounds, mechanics and more.

To do for First Release:
_____________________________________________________________________
REALISTC GOALS
- Underground pitstone structures
- Wight tower
- Any other little things we could get in e.g. small huts
- Finish any remaining herblore stuff, including the guide
- Finish the middle gem circle
- Pieces of lore for loot
- Finish/fix any loot
- Dreadful Peatmummy (new mini-boss)

COSMETIC GOALS (NOT NECESSARY FOR AN ALPHA RELEASE)
- Custom menu (can be basic, as long as its got the custom music and mod logo)
- Loading screens (if anyone knows someone who can do these then please grab em, because otherwise I'll do them and they'll suck)

UNREALISTC GOALS
- GET THE BASICS OF THE DAMN TEMPLES IN
- Temple Guarians (finish off some AI/middle gem stuff and add the last one)
- Stalker (new cave specific mob, WE NEED A MODEL FROM LEN)
- Mud Golem (new utility mob)
- Giant Toad (new tameable/mountable mob, JUST USE THE EXISTING MODEL WE CAN RETEXTURE IT TO MAKE IT LOOK NICER)

On top of that, we need to make sure that all bugs are ironed out and any odd little features finished etc. If we can get other bits done along the way then that's great but we need to get these done. Honestly there are other things that I'd rather have done before release in addition to these BUT WE NEED TO GET THIS THING DONE. Capiche?
