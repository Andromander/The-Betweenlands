*The Betweenlands*
A large and expansive mod for Minecraft by Angry Pixel that adds a whole new dimension to the game, with new blocks, items, mobs, strucutres, biomes, sounds, mechanics and more.

To do for First Release:
_____________________________________________________________________
REALISTC GOALS
- Finish off some Wight Tower stuff (nearly done)
- Any other little things we could get in e.g. small huts
- Pieces of lore for loot
- Finish/fix any loot (nearly done)
- Dreadful Peatmummy (nearly done, needs drops and spawning)
- Giant Toad (new tameable/mountable mob)

COSMETIC GOALS (plzzzzz guys?)
- Loading screens (if anyone knows someone who can do these then please grab em, because otherwise I'll do them and they'll suck)

On top of that, we need to make sure that all bugs are ironed out and any odd little features finished etc. If we can get other bits done along the way then that's great but we need to get these done. Honestly there are other things that I'd rather have done before release in addition to these BUT WE NEED TO GET THIS THING DONE. Capiche?
