Before you start writing an issue, please read up on the common issues on the main page

For issues:
 * use a descriptive and concise title
 * include the version of Forge and the Betweenlands you are using
 * specify whether it happens in singleplayer or multiplayer (and if so, what server is used, e.g. Vanilla, Thermos, Sponge etc.)
 * provide a detailed and comprehensible description, if possible also include instructions on how to reproduce it
 * upload the full crash log if available and include a link to said crash log
 * not post multiple problems in one issue. Create multiple issues instead


Feel free to include pictures of the problem you are having, if that helps.
You may also create issues for suggestions. If you have multiple suggestions please post them in one single issue.

If you do not follow these rules your issues will be closed and ignored.
